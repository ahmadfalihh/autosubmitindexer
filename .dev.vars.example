# Environment Variables for Local Development

# 1. Create a file named .dev.vars in the root directory (same level as package.json)
# 2. Paste your keys in the following format:

BING_API_KEY="your_bing_api_key_here"

NAVER_CLIENT_ID="your_naver_client_id"
NAVER_CLIENT_SECRET="your_naver_secret"

# 3. For Google, you must paste the ENTIRE content of your service-account.json file
#    IT MUST BE ON A SINGLE LINE. Escape quotes if necessary, but usually standard JSON string is fine.
#    Easiest way: Open service-account.json, minify it (remove newlines), and paste it.
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='{"type": "service_account", "project_id": "...", ...}'

# WARNING: NEVER COMMIT .dev.vars TO CITOR GIT!
